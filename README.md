## Hi there 👋

I am a Data Scientist based in Berlin with a fondness for Natural Langauge Processing, as it brings together both of my favorite hobbies: Computers, and Languages. 

- 🔭 I’m currently *working* on developing LLM-powered assistants for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center. 
- 🌱 I’m currently *learning* iOS development with swift, developping my own side-project.
- 📫 How to reach me: `thibo.rosemplatt@gmail.com`
