**About work.**

I started working in the industry with work involving the fine-tuning of language models (such as BERT) for tasks including key sentence extraction from PDF documents, automatic text simplification, and grammatical error correction.

I then expanded my expertise to the development of multi-channel chatbots (text, voice, DTMF) for contact centers. This work involved training and fine-tuning Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models, as well as designing complex conversational architectures.

As the LLM hype arose, I started working with Microsoft on the _Dynamics 365 Contact Center_ application. My role focuses on leveraging LLM capabilities to build features that enhance customer service efficiency by empowering agents with AI-driven tools.
